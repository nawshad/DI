## All things related to agentic AI:
- We will start with LangGraph, and here we will
have codes, easily creating and firing LangGraphs, i.e.
- Creating Nodes
- Connecting Nodes
- Creating External and Internal Memories and connect with Agents.
- Testing LangGraphs for various cases
- Boilerplate codes for various Agentic Framework, e.g. React.
- Toolcalling, ideally we will be using various utility functions for creating
tools and call from here (the tool calling factory will be in tools/).
