### Coding Conventions:
- Adhere to SOLID priniciple as much as possible.
- For each task, create an abstract class with common functions and 
strictly use Typing for that class.
  - All the sub-classes will inherit the basic functions from the base class
  but do specific stuffs as needed.
  - Use debug_decorator when needed, by default we use it in overridden methods in
  sub-classes.

### Naming Conventions:
- Class names will be CapsLocked
- Object names will be objectNamed
- Variable names will be lowercase_and_underscored
- single word string will be in '' but multi-words will be in ""
- Follow README.md under each directory to get the idea what is expected in those directories
- 'lab' folder under each directory is used to try new things before applying those
- 'outdated' folder will contain obsolete code for future reference, just replace with recent ones!
- README.md under root will be used as the starting point to navigate different areas in the project
and high level project overview.
- file names under each folder must be all lowercase_and_underscored.
- file names will be short string summary of the content of the file.
