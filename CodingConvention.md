### To Coder it may concern:
- Adhere to SOLID prinicipal as much as possible.
- For each task, create an abstract class with common functions and 
strictly use Typing for that class
- All the sub-classes will inherit the basic functions from the base class
but do specific stuffs as needed.
- Class name will be CapsLocked
- Object name will be objectNamed
- single word string will be in '' but multi-words will be in ""
- Follow README.md under each directory to get the idea what is expected in those directories
- 'lab' folder under each directory is used to try new things before applying those
- 'outdated' folder will contain obsolete code for reference
- README.md under root will be used as the starting point to navigate different areas in the project
and high level project overview.
